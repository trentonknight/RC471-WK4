    \begin{abstract}
Throughout life I have experienced times where my spirituality seemed like a torrent. I have also experienced times where I felt like I was cut off from the the Headwaters and forming a Billabong, or worse, a dry river bed. I am still learning how to seek God and my own spirituality. Above concerns for myself, I am a father now and have children I must help guide in this river of life. This notion makes my search all the more critical.

    \section{Headwaters}
\begin{doublespace}
In the beginning of my life I had two parents who valued their relationship with God and put him first. I was able to read at a very early age due to the Bible studies and associated reading. My brother, sister and I would study from the bible at least two times a week if not more. This was not including the attendance of what the Jehovah's Witness call the Kingdom Hall for additional reading and studies. I can honestly say that my parents did everything they could to ensure I understood the importance of God's word. Acknowledging this, I would have to say my parents were a huge factor in my spiritual growth. Up until I was a young adult I did not stray from the faith I was raised in. Specifically, I remained a Jehovah's Witness and could not imagine living any other way. After a series of family tragedies and life changes I felt isolated from my original teachings and lifestyle of the Jehovah's Witnesses.  I began to unknowingly remove myself from my faith. The first scripture my father had me memorize was \bibleverse{IJohn}(5:19). I feel that I am guilty alone for my division from God but in this case I also feel my environment was a helpful contributer. \bibleverse{IJohn}(5:19) gives a pretty clear warning:
\begin{verse}
19 We know that we are children of God,† and that the whole world is under the control of the evil one.† 
\end{verse}
