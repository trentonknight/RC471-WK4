    \begin{abstract}
Throughout life I have experienced times where my spirituality seemed like a torrent. I have also experienced times where I felt like I was cut off from the the Headwaters and forming a Billabong, or worse, a dry river bed. I am still learning how to seek God and my own spirituality. Above concerns for myself, I am a father now and have children I must help guide in this river of life. This notion makes my search all the more critical.

    \section{Headwaters}
\begin{doublespace}
In the beginning of my life I had two parents who valued their relationship with God and put him first. I was able to read at a very early age due to the Bible studies and associated reading. My brother, sister and I would study from the bible at least two times a week if not more. This was not including the attendance of what the Jehovah's Witness call the Kingdom Hall for additional reading and studies. I can honestly say that my parents did everything they could to ensure I understood the importance of God's word.
